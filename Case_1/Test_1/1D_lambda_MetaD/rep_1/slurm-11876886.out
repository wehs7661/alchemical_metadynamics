Reading file sys1_EXE.tpr, VERSION 2021.4-plumed-2.8.0 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 0.9 to 0.998

Using 128 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process

starting mdrun 'Argon in water'
50000000 steps, 100000.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up sys1_EXE.gro to ./#sys1_EXE.gro.1#


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 8.9%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 68%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 6.0%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.623
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 15.0 %

NOTE: 6.0 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
NOTE: 15.0 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.


NOTE: 20 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options

GROMACS reminds you: "This is extremely unlikely." (Berk Hess)
