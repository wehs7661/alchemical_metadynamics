Reading file sys2.tpr, VERSION 2021.4-plumed-2.8.0 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 0.9 to 0.999

Using 64 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 2 OpenMP threads per MPI process

100000000 steps, 200000.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: PME load balancing increased the non-bonded workload by more than 50%.
      For better performance, use (more) PME ranks (mdrun -npme),
      or if you are beyond the scaling limit, use fewer total ranks (or nodes).


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 15.6%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 65%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 10.2%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.227
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 6.6 %

NOTE: 10.2 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
NOTE: 6.6 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.


NOTE: 5 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
